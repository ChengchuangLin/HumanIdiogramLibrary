*Do you study human genetics, genomics, or cell biology?*

*Do you like making astetically pleasing figures and slides involving human chromosomes, but making vectorized schematics yourself seems like too much work?*  

*Have you ever wished for a library of human chromosomes for drag-and-drop figure and slide creation?*  

If any of the above describe you, **look no further**!  You may be in luck.

#### Contents  
  

This repository contains image files with idiograms for each of the 24 primary human chromosomes, as well as one for the entire genome lined up.  

These images are oragnized into four directories, based on file type:  
1. `illustrator` contains Adobe Illustrator files, and are suffixed with `.ai`
2. `pdf` contains pdf files, and are suffixed with `.pdf`  
3. `png` contains png image files, and are suffixed with `.png`
4. `vector` contains vector graphics files, and are suffixed with `.svg`
